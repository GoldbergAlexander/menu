This is a team project consisting of Alexander Goldberg, Safa Asadi, Konstantin Keller and Brett Goldfine.

For this project, we are building an interactive restaurant menu in which a user can create their own distinct order with a stylish, easy to use interface. In our app, users can add different items offered on the menu to their cart which will save between visits. They can create different users the purchase the items from the cart and remove items from the cart. The program will save each users specific order history in a database which can be displayed when the user purchases their items.

Also, our page features an admin section where the admin(restaurant owner) can enter in the item name, item description, and price of an item they'd like to add to the menu. They can also delete and update these items.

Login to the admin page by clicking on admin and use the following information:
username: admin
password: passwd
